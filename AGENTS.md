## Project Purpose

Topic Similarity MVP is a research-topic similarity checker. It uses a Node/Express backend, React/Vite frontend, Python FastAPI SBERT-style embedding service, and PostgreSQL/Prisma data model to compare submitted topics against existing topic records.

## Main Repo Areas

- `backend/`: Express API, Prisma schema, similarity services, middleware, tests, and setup scripts.
- `frontend/`: React/Vite UI for topic entry and tiered similarity results.
- `sbert-service/`: FastAPI embedding service with 384-dimensional embeddings and fallback mode.
- `docs/`: practical project documentation, including archived status notes in `docs/archive/status-reports/` and API docs in `docs/api/`.
- Root Markdown files: historical guides, status reports, audits, and implementation notes; freshness needs verification.
- Seed CSV files: sample/import data for topic records.

## Protected Core Files And Logic

Do not change these casually. Inspect dependencies and behavior first.

- `backend/src/server.js`
- `backend/src/controllers/similarity.controller.js`
- `backend/src/services/jaccard.service.js`
- `backend/src/services/tfidf.service.js`
- `backend/src/services/sbert.service.js`
- `backend/src/utils/preprocessing.js`
- `backend/src/config/env.js`
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- `backend/prisma/seed.js`
- `sbert-service/app.py`
- `sbert-service/requirements.txt`
- `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/features/TopicInput/TopicForm.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/features/Results/ResultsDisplay.jsx`
- `frontend/vite.config.js`
- `frontend/package.json`
- `frontend/package-lock.json`

Protect the similarity scoring, result tiering, LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk logic, API response shape, Prisma data model, frontend response mapping, and SBERT fallback behavior from accidental changes.

## Working Rules

- Inspect the relevant files and docs before changing anything.
- Prefer small, low-risk edits over broad rewrites.
- Do not guess when unsure; write `needs verification`.
- Update docs when behavior, commands, ports, setup steps, or API shapes change.
- Do not overwrite existing work without checking the worktree and reading affected files.
- Avoid editing generated/local output such as `coverage/`, `dist/`, `logs/`, and `sbert-service/venv/`.
- Keep changes aligned with the existing repo structure and implementation style.

## Testing Rule

After code changes, recommend the relevant tests or verification steps. Typical checks may include:

- Backend: `cd backend && npm test`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm test`
- Frontend build: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- SBERT service: `cd sbert-service && python test_service.py`
- Manual verification: backend health endpoint, frontend topic submission, and end-to-end results display.

If a command cannot be run or its result is unknown, mark it as `needs verification`.

## Pull Request Rule

Prefer small focused PRs. Each PR should include a clear summary, files changed, verification performed, known risks, and any items that need verification.
