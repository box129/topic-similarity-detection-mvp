# Topic Import Workflow

## Purpose

Import support exists because departmental research topic records are mostly spreadsheet-based and may be incomplete. Lecturer interview findings show that topic titles are usually available, but keywords, population, location, and study focus may be missing or inconsistent.

The current import foundation is designed to tolerate incomplete records safely while supporting backend preview and commit endpoints, before frontend import UI, embedding generation, or similarity integration is added.

## Current Flow

```text
.xlsx file -> worksheet rows -> plain row objects -> normalizer -> records + report -> persistence service
```

The import flow currently has three backend service layers:

- `backend/src/services/topicImportFile.service.js`
  - Reads `.xlsx` files with `exceljs`.
  - Uses the first worksheet by default.
  - Converts worksheet rows into plain JavaScript objects using the header row.
  - Passes parsed rows into `normalizeTopicImportRows`.

- `backend/src/services/topicImport.service.js`
  - Normalizes plain row objects into topic import records.
  - Handles flexible title aliases and optional context fields.
  - Preserves the original row as `raw_record`.
  - Returns normalized records plus an import report.

- `backend/src/services/topicImportPersistence.service.js`
  - Persists normalized records to Prisma models.
  - Routes records by `lifecycle_bucket`.
  - Stores context and import metadata fields prepared in the Prisma schema.
  - Returns a persistence report with inserted, skipped, failed, and per-bucket counts.

The backend also exposes preview and commit API endpoints:

- `POST /api/import/topics/preview`
  - Parses and normalizes an uploaded `.xlsx` file.
  - Returns records and the import report.
  - Does not persist records.

- `POST /api/import/topics/commit`
  - Parses and normalizes an uploaded `.xlsx` file.
  - Persists accepted records by lifecycle bucket.
  - Returns the import report and persistence report.

A repeatable smoke-test workflow is documented in [`../testing/import-smoke.md`](../testing/import-smoke.md).

## Normalized Record Fields

Each accepted record can include:

- `title`
- `keywords`
- `population`
- `location`
- `study_focus`
- `lifecycle_bucket`
- `raw_record`
- `warnings`

`title` is required. Rows without a usable title are skipped and counted in the report.

`keywords` may be provided as a comma-separated string or an array. Missing keywords are accepted.

`population`, `location`, and `study_focus` are optional for now. Missing values do not block import, but they add warnings because lecturers consider these fields important when judging topic similarity.

## Lifecycle Buckets

Supported lifecycle buckets are:

- `historical`
- `current_session`
- `under_review`

If no lifecycle bucket is provided, the normalizer defaults to `historical`.

Rows may contain `status`, but it is only mapped to `lifecycle_bucket` when it clearly matches one of the supported lifecycle buckets. Otherwise, the status value remains in `raw_record` and a warning is added.

## Import Report

The import report includes:

- `total_rows`
- `accepted_rows`
- `skipped_rows`
- `missing_title_rows`
- `incomplete_context_rows`
- `duplicate_title_rows`

Duplicate titles are detected within the same import batch using a case-insensitive trimmed title. The first matching row is accepted, and later duplicate-title rows are skipped.

Missing-title rows increment both `skipped_rows` and `missing_title_rows`.

Duplicate-title rows increment both `skipped_rows` and `duplicate_title_rows`.

`incomplete_context_rows` counts accepted rows missing at least one of `population`, `location`, or `study_focus`.

## Current Limitations

- Backend preview and commit endpoints exist, but no frontend import UI is wired to them yet.
- No similarity scoring integration yet.
- No embedding generation for imported records yet.
- No authorization/admin protection is implemented for import endpoints yet.
- CSV import remains separate from this `.xlsx` import workflow.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add import validation UI and import result display.
- Add authorization/admin protection for import endpoints.
- Add embedding generation for imported records.
- Integrate imported context fields into similarity scoring.
- Test the workflow with real sample departmental records.
- Add evaluation cases for incomplete and spreadsheet-imported records.
